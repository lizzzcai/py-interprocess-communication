'''
To distinguish messages better, we can mandate a separator character in the pipe. An
end-of-line makes this easy, because we can wrap the pipe descriptor in a file object
with os.fdopen and rely on the file objectâ€™s readline method to scan up through the
next \n separator in the pipe.

# same as pipe1.py, but wrap pipe input in stdio file object
# to read by line, and close unused pipe fds in both processes
